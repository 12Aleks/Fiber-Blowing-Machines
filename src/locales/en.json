      "descriptionFirst": "Our fiber optic blowing system consists of the electric MultiTank feeder and convertible blowing heads. This highly universal set is adapted to work with both microtubes and HDPE pipes. There is no need to drive the feeder with an air compressor, which reduces the air flow demand. The blowing machine can be used with a smaller and cheaper compressor. A built-in data logger allows generating blowing reports.",

      "descriptionFirst": "The MultiTank R feeder is equipped with a data logger recording all the parameters required by inspectors: resistance, speed and pressure as a function of blown-in cable length. Other fixed parameters such as date and time, temperature and GPS coordinates are recorded automatically.",
      "descriptionSecond": "After transferring data from the MultiTank to a computer a report can be generated in an on-line application. Additionally all the files with cable installation parameters are saved in the User account and can be accessed online on any device."

        "descriptionFirst": "The MultiTank S feeder features a fully electric drive. As compared to pneumatic feeders, it reduces air demand by approximately 0.5 m^3 so the air compressor can be smaller and less expensive.",
        "descriptionSecond": "An additional advantage of the device is no need to connect compressed air when installing cables on short distances, which considerably reduces noise while operating in densely built up areas.",
        "descriptionThird": "The MultiTank S feeder is a universal device due to convertible blowing heads which enable installation of optical fiber cables from the 3–22 mm range as well as microducts packages even as large as 8 x 10 mm. The device can work in the harshest weather conditions – in the rain and sub-zero temperatures.",
        "descriptionFourth": "The feeding force and speed are controlled independently and regulated by potentiometers. LCD displays show the main parameters such as the length of the cable blown in, current resistance value and pressure in the pipe duct.",
        "descriptionFifth": "There is no need to change belts while blowing in optical fibers of different diameters. Belt pressure is regulated by springs which prevent cable crushing or skidding.",
